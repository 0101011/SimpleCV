SimpleCV: a kinder, gentler machine vision library 
======================================================

SimpleCV's goal is to provide a convenient, readable wrapper for OpenCV which will allow programmers who are linear-algebra illiterate to access the power of its functionality.  Whereas OpenCV's goals are power and performance, SimpleCV seeks to provide an easy to use programming interface for casual machine vision users.
